          {
            "q": "What is a reading screening?",
            "a": "A reading screening is a brief assessment that looks at foundational reading skills to identify potential areas of concern and risk patterns. It's not a diagnostic test, but rather a first step in understanding a child's reading development. Our screenings look at skills like phonological awareness, phonics/decoding, sight words, fluency, and comprehension indicators."
          },
          {
            "q": "Is this a diagnostic evaluation?",
            "a": "No. This is an educational screening service to identify skill patterns and risk. It does not diagnose a disability. Screenings can identify potential concerns that may warrant further assessment by a licensed professional. If concerns are identified, I'll provide clear recommendations for next steps."
          },
          {
            "q": "Who conducts the screenings?",
            "a": "I'm an Educational Specialist with 16 years of experience spanning from classroom teacher (intellectual disabilities and autism) to administrative dean. My background includes MTSS/RTI systems, special education processes, 504 plans, and educational assessment."
          },
          {
            "q": "Why is this service free?",
            "a": "Free screening is available because I believe all families should have access to early identification services. I also offer paid upgrades (Comprehensive Literacy Review) for families who want extended assessment, a detailed report, and an interpretation call."
          },
          {
            "q": "What is the \"Comprehensive Literacy Review\" upgrade?",
            "a": "The paid upgrade includes: a Part 2 extended assessment session targeted based on screener results, a comprehensive written report with interpretation, intervention plans, accommodation suggestions, school support pathways guidance, and a 30-minute interpretation call with me."

            "q": "How do you ensure my child is responding meaningfully?",
            "a": "Our Split-Screen Assessment System keeps the student view completely clean—just the stimulus, no distractions. I observe behavior throughout and capture detailed observations about attention, effort, and engagement. At the end of each session, I rate validity to flag any concerns."

            "q": "What if my child is distracted or guessing?",

          },
          {
            "q": "Why does a parent need to be present?",
            "a": "Parent presence helps ensure the child feels comfortable and supported. It also provides accountability for testing conditions—quiet space, minimal distractions, and stable technology. You can observe quietly in the background."
          },
          {
            "q": "What behaviors do you observe and why?",
            "a": "I rate attention, effort, impulsivity, frustration tolerance, avoidance behaviors, and responsiveness to redirection. These observations help interpret results and identify when performance may not reflect true ability."
          },
          {
            "q": "What happens if results may not be valid?",
            "a": "Results are interpreted within testing conditions. If distractions or technology influenced performance, it is noted. The validity status (valid, questionable, or invalid) affects how results are presented and what next steps are recommended."

            "q": "What technology do I need?",

            "q": "What if concerns are identified?",

This might include: requesting a formal evaluation from your school district, requesting a 504 plan or intervention plan, seeking private evaluation, or specific intervention strategies for home."
